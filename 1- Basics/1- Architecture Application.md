the user to interact with the application.'

interaction with the flutter application. The interaction includes gestures like tapping, dragging, 
and swiping, etc. These features can be used to creatively enhance the user experiences of the app by 
making it perform desired actions based on simple gestures.

a hierarchy based on the decreasing level of these complexities.'
